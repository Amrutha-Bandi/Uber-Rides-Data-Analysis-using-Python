Technology Stack : Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Abstract : This project delves into the analysis of Uber rides data using Python, aiming to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset. The analysis encompasses various aspects, including ride frequency, duration, geographical distribution, and peak hours. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Insights derived from this analysis can provide valuable information for optimizing service efficiency, identifying potential areas for expansion, and enhancing user experience within the Uber platform.  
In Simple Terms the goal of this project is to use Python to analyze a large amount of data from Uber. We'll use Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to look at the data closely. By doing this, we hope to find useful information that can help Uber make better decisions and improve how their services work.
